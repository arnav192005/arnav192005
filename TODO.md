# Task: Distribute Planets Equally on Both Sides and Moving Clockwise

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed the HTML file and understood the solar system structure
- [x] Removed general animation from .orbit class
- [x] Created separate keyframes for each orbit with offset starting rotations (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, 315°)
- [x] Updated .orbit-1 through .orbit-8 classes to use specific animations
- [x] Verified changes maintain clockwise movement

## Summary
The planets are now distributed equally around the solar system with some positioned on the left side and others on the right side of the sun, all moving in a clockwise direction. Each orbit starts at a different angle to achieve even distribution.
